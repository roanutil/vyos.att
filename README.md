AT&amp;T Fiber RG bypass with VyOS (including IPv6)

Following multiple discussions and instructions on bypassing AT&T residential gateway using PfSense or [AsusWRT-Merlin] (https://github.com/bypassrg/att), this guide is focused on configuring VyOS powered router to be plugged directly to the ONT.
Most of it is applicable to any linux based systems (and should be easier to configure in fact).
Essential part is the native IPv6 support, which was very important to keep for me.

Hardware tested and used - [Protectli Vault FW4B] (https://protectli.com/product/fw4b/), VyOS version - 1.3-rolling-202006xx
AT&T RG - BGW210-700

## Obtaining ATT BGW210 configuration
This has been thoroughly covered recently.
Credits go to [reddit.com/user/Streiw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ATT/comments/g59rwm/bgw210700_root_exploitbypass/). 

Once the access is obtained, the following information needs to be backed up:
- mfg.dat (as described in [https://pastebin.com/SUGLTfv4](https://pastebin.com/SUGLTfv4))
- root certificates, eg:
```
tar cf /www/att/cert.tar /etc/rootcert/
```
- DUID (essential for IPv6)
```
cp /var/etc/dhcp6c_duid /www/att/
```
- [Optional] RG WAN interface MAC address (`ifconfig br2` or HTTP interface, it's also extracted by `mfg_dat_decode`, see the next step)

## WPA configuration
### Certificates
Using `mfg_dat_decode` by [Sergey (devicelocksmith)] (https://www.devicelocksmith.com/2018/12/eap-tls-credentials-decoder-for-nvg-and.html), extract and repackage credentials.
Just copy `mfg.dat` and DER certificates from `cert.tar` into the same directory and run `MacOS X`.

Notes:
- MacOS X didn't work in my 10.15, i've used Linux version instead.
- DER files from cert.tar should be in the same level as `mfg.dat` and `mfg_dat_decoder` (**not** in `./etc/rootcerts`).
Please pay attention to the output, especially errors. For instance, there should be lines:
```
Verifying certificates.. success!
Validating private key.. success!
Found valid AAA server root CA certificates:
```
in the decoder output. In case of:
```
WARNING: No valid server root Certificate Authority DER files found in xxxx
```
it'll likely not work.
### VyOS configuration
- Unpack generated `EAP-TLS_8021x_xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.tar.gz` and copy 3 pem files along with `wpa_supplicant.conf` to the VyOS router. I've used `/config/auth/att/` directory.
- [Optional] Make sure the RG MAC addresss matches to what has been extracted and configured in `wpa_supplicant.conf`.
- Configure WAN/ONT interface to use the RG MAC address 2 (two) times in the following configuration snippet (AT&T DHCP would not respond to any other MAC address. In addition, the DHCP request should be coming in VLAN 0). Also, please note, the ONT port is `eth3` in my example, but in most cases WAN `eth0` port will be used instead. DO NOT CHANGE THE HW-ID FIELD. This field is used by VyOS to accomplish persistent device naming. It allows VyOS to consistently name a device with a particular HW MAC address to be name the same on each bootup, even if the hardware moves in the system or it's configuration changes.
```
vyos@vyos# show interfaces ethernet eth3
 hw-id yy:yy:yy:yy:yy:yy
 mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
 vif 0 {
     address dhcp
     mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
 }
```
- VyOS is not supporting wired 802.1x configuration at this moment. However, it's still supported by the network scripts being used in the environment, and the `/etc/network/interfaces` config file is neither generated/altered by VyOS, nor conflicting with it. Adding the following lines to the file should result in `wpa_supplicant` started and running. wpa_supplicant should be run on the untagged interface, and we don't want it to get any IPs or routes, so we can use manual.
```
auto eth3
iface eth3 inet manual
wpa-driver wired
wpa-conf /config/auth/att/wpa_supplicant.conf
```
- [**NB!**] Direct configuration would persist reboots, but would **not** survive the VyOS upgrade (only VyOS configuration is guaranteed to be saved). All the configuration outside of VyOS configuration shell should be saved and reapplied as needed. This is also applicable to direct configuration of some files in [IPv6 section](#ipv6-configuration). See the list of files, suggested to be changed: [List of directly modified files](#list-of-directly-modified-files).
- NAT configuration is standard:
```
vyos@vyos# show nat source rule 100
 outbound-interface eth3.0
 source {
     address 192.168.0.0/16
 }
 translation {
     address masquerade
 }
```
- After committing, the interface (`eth3.0`) should up and configured with DHCP address shortly.
To debug, look into `/var/log/messages` and/or run `wpa_supplicant` manually:
```
sudo /usr/sbin/wpa_supplicant  -Dwired -ieth3 -c /config/auth/wpa_supplicant.conf -ddd
```

## IPv6 configuration
### DUID
DUID configuration is essential to configure IPv6. AT&T would not respond without expected information in DUID. The easiest is to use the AT&T RG `dhcp6c_duid` file. `dhcp6c` is implicitely using, if the file resides in the right place. In VyOS the location is `/var/lib/dhcpv6/dhcp6c_duid`. The size is 29 bytes in my case.
### IA-NA/IA-PD
VyOS is hardcoding values for NA=1, PD=2 in the [template](https://github.com/vyos/vyos-1x/blob/current/data/templates/dhcp-client/ipv6.tmpl) used to generate the `dhcp6c` configuration file (eg. `/run/dhcp6c/dhcp6c.eth3.0.conf`). With these values, AT&T has never responded with IPv6 addresses.
However, NA=0, PD=1 are working flawlessly for me. The following direct change of `/usr/share/vyos/templates/dhcp-client/ipv6.tmpl` file required:

On the other hand, I have been using NA=1, PD=2 without issue -jzatarski, 2020-08-02

### dhcp6c configuration
Having proper `dhcp6c` NA/PD configured, the following configuration is straightforward enough:
```
vyos@vyos# show interfaces ethernet eth3
 hw-id xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
 mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
 vif 0 {
     address dhcp
     address dhcpv6
     dhcpv6-options {
         prefix-delegation {
             interface eth1 {
                 sla-id 1
                 sla-len 4
             }
             length 60
         }
     }
     mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
 }
```
... except `sla-len`. Please note, that AT&T currently allocates /60 prefixes. It leaves 4 bits for SLA. If not configured correctly, the following error would occur:
```
add_ifprefix: invalid prefix length 60 + 16 + 64
```
Note, the configuration above is configuring `eth1` port for the prefix delegation (LAN port). If your setup is different, please adjust.

### RA
Trivial (again, `eth1` for the prefix delegation):
```
vyos@vyos# show service router-advert
 interface eth1 {
     prefix ::/64 {
     }
     reachable-time 0
     retrans-timer 0
 }
```

### Debugging
To debug, `dhcp6c` could be run manually (you can specify any experimental config):
```
sudo /usr/sbin/dhcp6c -D -f -c /run/dhcp6c/dhcp6c.eth3.0.conf eth3.0
```
To verify DUID being properly obtained and used:
```

```
vyos@vyos# show interfaces ethernet eth1 ipv6
 address {
     autoconf
 }
vyos@vyos# ip -6 addr show dev eth1 | egrep inet6 | awk -F ' +|/' '{print $3}' | egrep 2600:

## Miscellaneous
### Firewall
Please do not forget that your router would start to be exposed to the public internet. Please, make sure your firewall is configured as needed and sshd is either not exposed at all, or is using public keys only, or the default password has been changed to very long generated one.

### Tuning/optimizations
This is out of the scope of this guide, but in some cases additional configuration is needed to achieve the RG reference performance.
Example - Protectli FW4B was not able to achieve more than 500-600 Mbit using `eth3` interface for WAN.
The bottleneck happened because it was only using 1 core (out of 4) and by default the `eth2/eth3` ethernet interfaces was only using 1 queue.

Ethernet I210 is supporting 4 combined queues, to permanently (surviving reboots) fix, add `ethtool -L eth3 combined 4` to `/config/scripts/vyos-postconfig-bootup.script`. (`ethtool -G eth3 tx 4096 rx 4096` wouldn't hurt as well).

### List of directly modified files
Besides the VyOS configuration, it's useful to backup:
- `/config/auth/att` - certificates and wpa configuration
- `/etc/network/interfaces` - wired wpa_supplicant
- `/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules` - to stick interface names
- `/usr/share/vyos/templates/dhcp-client/ipv6.tmpl` - NA/PD values for IPv6
- `/config/scripts/vyos-postconfig-bootup.script` - ethtool etc.

### AT&T public subnet
You can get public /29 subnet for $15/mo. In case you find it appealing, it's only sufficient to configure the translation address in NAT (pick any of 6 available addresses for different rules or use all of them as a range):
```
vyos@vyos# show nat source rule 100
 outbound-interface eth3.0
 source {
     address 192.168.0.0/16
 }
 translation {
     address <YOUR_PUBLIC_IP>
 }
```
